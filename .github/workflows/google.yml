# This workflow will build a docker container, publish it to Google Container Registry, and deploy it to GKE when there is a push to the "master" branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Ensure that your repository contains the necessary configuration for your Google Kubernetes Engine cluster, including deployment.yml, kustomization.yml, service.yml, etc.
#
# 2. Create and configure a Workload Identity Provider for GitHub (https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation)
#
# 3. Change the values for the GAR_LOCATION, GKE_ZONE, GKE_CLUSTER, IMAGE, REPOSITORY and DEPLOYMENT_NAME environment variables (below).
#
# For more support on how to run the workflow, please visit https://github.com/google-github-actions/setup-gcloud/tree/master/example-workflows/gke-kustomize
